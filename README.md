TravelBook is an iOS application that allows you to save the locations, names, and descriptions of places you visit by marking them on a map. It can help you get directions to the places you've saved when you want to revisit them. MapKit and CoreData frameworks are used.

## Features

- **Save Data**: The entered data is saved using CoreData.
- **Listing**: Saved locations are displayed in a list view. You can view details by clicking on a location's name.
- **Delete**: Swipe left on a location in the list to delete it.
- **Get Directions**: Click on a saved location to get directions via the map application.
